            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is preſented unto thee a ſhort Treatiſe of the Art of Dialling. Concerning the antiquity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, and neceſſity thereof, I ſhall in this place ſay little, the Antiquity thereof being wel known to all who have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently read the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein mention is made of that of K. <hi>Ahaz,</hi> upon which the Almighty was pleaſed to expreſſe a Miracle for the recovery of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> by cauſing the Sun to go back ten degrees upon the ſaid Diall, and this is the firſt that was ever recorded, being above 2400 years agoe, ſince which time, Learning ſpreading it ſelfe over the whole Univerſe, hath made this Art more common.</p>
            <p>For the excellencie of it, the skill which is required in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Geometry, Aſtronomy,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:115735:3"/> 
               <hi>Optiques,</hi> for the making a man compleat and excellent, is an evident proof, for without good knowledge in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Geometry, with a competencie of knowledge in the circles of the Sphere, and ſome inſight in the <hi>Optiques,</hi> in vain doth a man beſtow his time in the ſtudy of this Art of Dialling.</p>
            <p>Now for the neceſſity of it, what is more neceſſary in a well ordered Commonwealth? What action can be performed in due ſeaſon without it? Or what man can appoint any buſineſſe with another, and not prefix a time, without the loſſe of that which cannot be re-gained, and ought therefore to be moſt prized.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe that all the light which we receive is from the great and glorious light of the World, <hi>[the SUN]</hi> we have fetcht the beams thereof from heaven, to enlighten the underſtandings of men upon earth, and from whoſe light we receive and retain the benefit of all our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>Therefore this Art of Dialling being in it ſelfe ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and neceſſary, may induce any induſtrious perſon to the practiſe thereof, the perfect knowledge whereof in this enſuing Treatiſe is ſufficiently taught, and that by ſuch briefe, eaſie, and familiar wayes, that not any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe hitherto publiſhed, can for convenience, eaſe, and quick diſpatch, be compared thereto.</p>
            <p>The whole Treatiſe conſiſteth of five Books, in which the whole myſtery of the Art of Dialling is plainly taught three ſeverall wayes, namely, two Geometrically, and the third Inſtrumentally.</p>

                  <p>Although the making or dividing of this line of Chords be well known unto all thoſe that do make Mathematicall Inſtruments, yet I would not have them that ſhall make uſe of this Book, be ignorant of the dividing of this line: Therefore, firſt, draw the Diameter A D C, which being done, upon the center D deſcribe the ſemicircle A B C, which ſemicircle divide into two equall parts or Quadrants by the point B, then dividing one of theſe Quadrants into 90 equall parts, or degrees, you are prepared, as here you ſee in the Quadrant A B.</p>
                  <p>Now this being done, ſet one foot of your Compaſſes in the point A, and let the other be extended unto each de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or the Quadrant A B, and theſe extents transfer into the line A D C, as here you ſee is done. This line ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 90 unequall diviſions from the point A, (and numbred by 10, 20, 30, 40, &amp;c. unto 90,) is called a line of Chords, and may be ſet on your Rule, as here you ſee is done. And this may be as well performed within the Quadrant D A B, by transferring the degree of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115735:18"/> A B into the line A E B, or into any other line: and here you may ſee that when you open your compaſſes unto 60 degrees in the Quadrant, and transfer it into the line A D, that it will light upon the center D, whereby it doth plainly appear that 60 of thoſe degrees are equall to the ſemidiameter of the ſame Circle, and therefore is the Radius upon which all circles are drawn, as was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before in this Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> How to finde the Altitude of the Sun without Inſtrument.</head>
               <p>IN the third Chapter of this Book it is ſhewed how to finde the Altitude of the Sun by a Gnomon ſet perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular to the Horizon, but ſeeing the ground is ſo unlevel it is not ſo ready for this our purpoſe, and perhaps ſome
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115735:32"/> may have occaſion to finde the altitude of the Sun, and thereby the Azimuth or houre of the day, according to the 17 or 18 Chapters, and yet may be unprovided of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to perform the ſame, or at leaſt may be abſent from them, therefore it will not be un-needfull to ſhew the finding of the ſame without the Gnomon or other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Take therefore a Trencher, or any ſimple boards end, of what faſhion ſoever, ſuch as you can get, make thereon two pricks, as A and B, then prick in a pin, naile, or ſhort wire in one of<figure>

                  </figure> the points, as at A, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hang a threed with a plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>met, then lift up this board toward the Sun, till the ſhadow of the pin at A, come directly on the point B, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the threed then falleth, there make a mark as at E, under the threed, then with your Rule and Compaſſe draw the lines A B and A E, and finde the angle B A E (by the ſecond Chapter) for that is the complement of the altitude of the Sun: or, when you have drawn A B and A E, you may make the Quadrant B A F by the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then the angle E A F ſhall be your altitude de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> How to finde out the Latitude of a place, or the Poles elevation above the Horizon, by the Sunne.</head>
               <p>SEeing that throughout this Book, the Latitude of the place is ſuppoſed to be known, when as every one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps cannot tell which way to finde it out, therefore it will not be un-needfull to ſhew how it may be readily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſufficiently for our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore you muſt get the Meridian Altitude, which you may doe by obſerving diligently about noon a little before, and a little after, ſtill obſerving untill you perceive the Sun to begin to fall again, then marking what was his greateſt altitude, will ſerve for this our preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Having gotten the Meridian altitude by this, and the Declination by the ſeventh Chapter, you may finde the Latitude of the place, or the elevation of the Pole above the Horizon after this manner. If the Sun hath North Declination, then ſubſtract the Declination out of the Meridian altitude, and the remainder ſhall be the height of the Equinoctiall. But if the Sun hath South Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then adde the Declination to the Meridian altitude, ſo ſhall the ſum of them give the altitude of the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which being taken out of the Quadrant or 90 degrees, leaveth the Latitude of your place, or the elevation of the Pole above your Horizon.</p>
               <p>As for example, upon the firſt day of <hi>May</hi> 1650, the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115735:33"/> Meridian altitude of the Sun being obſerved to be 55 deg. 35 min. upon which day I finde the Suns place to be in 20 deg. 48 min. of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and the declination 18 deg. 00 min. and becauſe the Declination is North, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract 18 deg. 00 min. out of the Meridian altitude 55 deg. 35 min. and there remains 37 deg. 35 min. the height of the Equinoctiall, and this taken out of 90 degrees, leaveth 52 deg. 25 min. for the Latitude of <hi>Thuring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be required ſomtimes for you to make a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for a Town or Countrey whoſe Latitude you know not, neither can come thither conveniently to obſerve it. Here is therefore added a Table ſhewing the Latitude of the moſt principall Cities and Towns in <hi>England,</hi> ſo that being required to make a Diall for any of thoſe places, you need but look in your Table, and there you have the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude thereof. But if the Town you ſeeke be not in the Table, looke what Town in the Table lies neere unto it, and make your Diall to that Latitude, which will occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on little difference.</p>

               <p>As for example, let the figure A B C D be a plane ſuppoſed to ſtand levell with the Horizon, and for to try the ſame, I take the ſimple boarde GOH, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one ſtreight ſide, as G H, then drawing a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel thereto, I croſſe it at right angles with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular O E, and at the point of interſection I cut out a little bit as at E, for the plummet to play in, then applying the ſide G H to the plane, with holding the perpendicular O E upright, and holding a threed with a plummet to play in the hole E, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115735:35"/> finding the threed to fall directly on the perpendicular E O, which way ſoever I turn the board, I therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be a horizontall plane.</p>

               <p>FOr the diſtinguiſhing of planes, becauſe their inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and declination may be diverſe, we will conſider three lines belonging to every plane: the firſt is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontall line; the ſecond the perpendicular line, croſſing the horizontall at right angles; the third is the Axis of the plane, croſſing both the horizontall line, and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, and the plane it ſelfe, at right angles; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of which Axis may be called, the pole of the planes horizontall line.</p>
               <p>The perpendicular line doth help to finde the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the horizontall line with his Axis to finde the Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the pole of the planes horizontall line, to give denomination unto the plane.</p>
               <p>When the plane ſtandeth upright, pointing directly into the Zenith, it maketh right angles with the Horizon, and is therefore called an erect plane, and a plumb line drawn thereon is called a Verticall line; as in this figure, the plane G H L I is erect, &amp; the line H I is the Verticall line.</p>
               <p>Now for the trying of this plane, if you apply the ſtreight ſide of your board vertically thereto, as here you ſee done in the figure C, and either hanging a threed and plummet in the point M, or holding up a threed and plummet with your hand, you finde the threed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115735:36"/> to fall directly on the parallel line M N it is an erect plane, but if the threed will croſſe the line M N, it is no erect plane, but inclineth to the Horizon.</p>
               <p>And if you finde your plane to be erect, you may by applying your board thereto, with the threed and plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met falling on the parallel line M N, draw the verticall line H I by the edge of your board, the verticall line being drawn, you may croſſe it at right angles with the line G L, which ſhall be levell with your Horizon, and therefore called the horizontall line of the plane.</p>
               <p>If the plane ſhall be found to incline to the horizon, you may finde out the inclination after this manner.</p>
               <p>Apply your board to the plane, as you ſee here by the figure B, in the plane F K E H, then holding up a threed and plummet that it may fall upon the perpendicular line O E, and turning about your board, till the ſtreight ſide thereof lie cloſe with the plane, and the threed fall on the perpendicular line O E, ſo the line drawn by the ſtreight ſide of the board, ſhall be an horizontall line, which here in this figure will be the line F E.</p>
               <p>This being done, croſſe the horizontall line at right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with the perpendicular H K, then ſet the ſtreight ſide of your board upon the line H K, which is perpendicular to the horizontall line, with holding the board up right, and holding up a threed and plummet, ſo that it may have free courſe to play by the ſide of the board, which it may have by letting the plummer fall within the hole, a little below X in the figure A: the threed thus hanging, mark two points directly under it, the one at X where the threed croſſeth the parallel line on the board, the other at T, at the upper ſide thereof, and ſo by drawing the line T X, you have the angle T X V, which is called the angle of Recli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115735:36"/> and it is the angle contained betwixt the plane and the verticall line paſſing from the Zenith to the Nadir, the complement of which angle is the inclination of the plane, and it is the angle that the plane maketh with the Horizon, the thing here deſired.</p>

               <p>By what is ſaid here of finding the inclination of the upper face, the inclination of the under face may ſoon be had, ſeeing they are both of one quantity in themſelves, therefore, if you apply the ſtreight ſide of your board to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115735:37"/> the perpendicular line of the under face, and hang the threed and plummet in any part of the parallel line, the angle that is made by that parallel line and the threed, ſhall be the complement of the angle of the inclination of the plane to the Horizon.</p>

               <p>ALL thoſe planes that have their Horizontall line lying Eaſt and Weſt, are in that reſpect ſaid to be direct verticall planes; if they be alſo upright paſſing thorow the Zenith, they are erect direct verticall planes; if they incline to the pole, they are direct polar planes; if to the Equinoctiall, they are called Equinoctiall planes, and are deſcribed before: if to none of theſe three points, they are then called direct verticals inclining.</p>
               <p>In all Dials that decline not, two things muſt be had before you can make the Diall, the firſt is the meridian or 12 a clock line, wherein the cock muſt ſtand, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the elevation of the pole above the ſame line.</p>
               <p>For the Horizontall plane, the meridian line is drawn by the 4 Chapter, and the elevation of the pole above the plane is always equall to the latitude of the place; and in erect direct verticals, the perpendicular or verticall line is the meridian or 12 a clock line, and the elevation of the pole above the plane is always equall to the complement of the latitude, the North pole being elevated above the North face, and the South pole above the South face thereof.</p>
               <p>And in theſe verticals inclining being direct, the line of inclination is their meridian, and line wherein the cock muſt ſtand, but for the elevation of the cock, we muſt firſt conſider, whether the plane inclines towards the South or towards the North; if it inclineth towards the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115735:46"/> South, adde the inclination to your latitude, the ſumme of both ſhall be the elevation of the pole above the plane, and if the ſumme ſhall be juſt 90 degrees, it is an Equinoctiall plane, and is deſcribed before in the 5 Chapter, but if the ſumme ſhall exceed 90 degrees, take it out of 180, and that which remaines ſhall be the elevation of the pole above the plane.</p>
               <p>As for example in the latitude of 52 deg. 30 min. let a plane be found to incline Southwards 20 degrees, this 20 deg. added to 52 deg. 30 min. the latitude of the place, the ſumme will be 72 degr. 30 min. the elevation of the pole above the plane, with which you may proceed to draw a Diall by the eighth or ninth Chapters as if it were a horizontall plane, for their difference is nothing, but in the height of the ſtile, which is the elevation of the pole above the plane. For this plane ſhall be parallel to that Horizon, whoſe latitude is 72 deg. 30 min. lying both under one and the ſame meridian.</p>
               <p>But if the inclination be Northward, compare the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination with your latitude, and take the leſſer out of the greater; ſo ſhall the difference be the elevation of the pole above the plane, but if there be no difference, it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect polar plane, and is deſcribed before in the ſixt Chapter.</p>
               <p>As in the latitude of 52 deg. 30 min. a plane being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to incline towards the North 25 deg. this 25 degr. being taken out of 52 degrees 30 minutes leaveth 27 deg. and 30 minutes for the elevation of the pole above the plane. Now this plane being parallel to that Horizon, whoſe latitude is 27 deg. 30 min. lying both under one &amp; the ſame meridian, therefore you may proceed to make this Diall, as if you were to make an Horizontall Diall in that countrey.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:115735:46"/>
               <p>Each of theſe planes have two faces; one towards the Zenith, the other towards the Nadir; but what is ſaid of the one is common to the other; they onely differ in this, the one hath the South, the other hath the North pole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated above their faces.</p>
               <p>For upon the upper faces of all North incliners, whoſe inclination is leſſe then the latitude of the place, on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der faces of all North incliners, whoſe inclination is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the latitude of the place; and on the upper faces of all South incliners, the North pole is elevated; and therefore contrarily, on the under faces of all North in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliners, whoſe inclination is leſſe then the latitude of the place, on the upper faces of all North incliners, whoſe inclination is greater then the latitude of the place; and on the under faces of all South incliners, the South pole is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated: unto one of which poles, the ſtiles of all Dialls muſt point directly.</p>

               <p>If they behold none of theſe four principall parts of the world, but ſhall ſtand between the prime verticall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115735:47"/> and the Meridian, they are then called by the generall name of declining verticals, or by the name of South or North erect declining planes.</p>
               <p>In all ſuch declining planes, becauſe the Meridian of the place (which in all upright planes is the verticall line, and ſerveth for the hour of 12) and the Meridian of the plane deflecteth one from the other; therefore we muſt finde out and place the Meridian of the plane, (which is the line over which the ſtile directly hangeth, and is here called the Subſtile) and likewiſe the elevation of the pole above the plane: both which may be eaſily performed in this manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt, draw a blinde line parallel to the Horizon, which may be the line A B, and from a point therein as at C, let fall the perpendicular C D, ſerving for the Meridian of the place, and the hour of 12, and through ſome place of this Meridian as at E, draw the line F G at right angles.</p>
               <p>Then having by the third chapter examined this plane, and finding it to decline 30 deg. from the South towards the Eaſt, I draw an arch of a circle upon the center C, with my compaſſes opened to the Radius of the Scale; in which arch I place the declination of the plane from E to H, on the ſame ſide of the meridian with the declination of the plane, as here you ſee; then ſet the complement of the latitude, which is 37 degr. 30 min. in the ſame arch from E to M, and draw the line C H for the declination of the plane, and the line C M G cutting the line F G in the point G for the complement of your latitude.</p>
               <p>This being done, take the diſtance E G; and ſet it in the line of declination from C to S, from which point S draw the line S L ſquare to the meridian C D, then take S L and ſet it from E to O in the line E F, and draw the line C O,

               <p>Then take the diſtance C L, and ſet it in the line of contingence from O to P, and draw the line C P for the ſtile.</p>

               <p>Now having drawn the line NT through the center C, and parallel to the touch-line I K, which will be ſquare to the Subſtile C O, I take the diſtance O <hi>y,</hi> which is the Radius upon which the Equinoctiall circle was drawn, and place it on both ſides the ſubſtile, in the line of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from O to I, and from O to K, and in his parallel line from C to G, and from C to R, and draw G I and R K, then laying your rule upon the point <hi>y,</hi> the center of the Equinoctiall, and <hi>a</hi> the point of interſection of the touch-line with the meridian, and where it cutteth the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles circumference, there muſt you begin to divide it into 24 equall parts, but thoſe ſix ſhall be onely in uſe which are next the line of contingence, that is, three of each ſide of the ſubſtile next thereunto.</p>
               <p>Then place your Ruler upon the center <hi>y,</hi> and upon each of theſe ſix points of the Equator, and where it toucheth the line of contingence, there make markes, by which and the center C, draw thoſe ſix hour lines next the Subſtilar; which ſhall all fall between the points I and K in the touch-line, three whereof ſhall fall betwixt O and K, and three betwixt O and I, thus have you 6 of your 12 hours, <hi>viz.</hi> 12. 11. 10. 9. 8. and 7. then take the diſtance from the point O to the interſection of the hour of 12 with the touch-line, and place it from O to <hi>b,</hi> and from G to N, then laying your Rule upon theſe two points N and <hi>b,</hi> where it ſhall croſſe the line G I, ſhall be the point through which you may draw the ſix a clock
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115735:48"/> hour-line; in like manner, take the diſtance from O to the line for 11 a clock, and ſet it from O to <hi>c,</hi> and from G to Z, then lay the Rule upon C and Z, and where it ſhall cut the line, G I ſhall be the point through which you ſhall draw the 5 a clock hour-line; and ſo placing the diſtance O 10 from O to <hi>g,</hi> and from G to V, and laying the Rule upon V and <hi>g,</hi> you ſhall finde the point in the line G I, through which you may draw the 4 a clock hour-line: in like manner may you proceed with the other ſide.</p>
               <p>For taking the diſtance from the point O to the line of 9, and ſetting it from O to <hi>h,</hi> and from R to <hi>x,</hi> and laying the Rule upon the points <hi>h</hi> and <hi>x,</hi> where you ſhall ſee it cut the line R K, there ſhall be the point, through which you ſhall draw the 3 a clock hour-line.</p>
               <p>And ſo you may take the diſtances from O, to the line of 8, and 7, and place them from O to <hi>d</hi> and <hi>m,</hi> and from R to W and T, and ſo by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Rule upon the points W <hi>d</hi> and T <hi>m,</hi> where it ſhall croſſe the line R K, there ſhall be the points through which the houre-lines of 2, and 1, ſhall be drawn.</p>
               <p>The Diall being thus drawn upon the South-eaſt face of this plane, let the ſtile be fixed in the center C, ſo that it may hang directly over the Subſtile C O, making an angle therewith equall to the angle P C O.</p>
               <p>The ſtile with the ſubſtile muſt here point down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, becauſe in all upright planes declining from the South, the South pole is elevated; and in all upright
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115735:49"/> planes declining from the North, the North pole is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated.</p>
               <p>Therefore if you were to make a Diall to the North face of this plane, you muſt make choice of your center C in the lower part of the Meridian C D, that the ſtile with the ſubſtile may have room to point upwards.</p>
               <p>This Diall being made on paper for the South-eaſt face of this plane, will alſo ſerve for the North-weſt face thereof, if you turn it upſide down; ſo that the ſtile with the ſubſtile may point upwards; and the paper being oyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or pricked through, ſo that you may take the back-ſide thereof for the fore-ſide, without altering the numbers, ſet to the hours.</p>
               <p>And the foreſide of this pattern, turned upſide down, ſo that the cock may point upwards, ſhall ſerve for the North-eaſt face of a plane having the ſame declination; onely altering the numbers ſet to the hours.</p>
               <p>This paper being oyled, if you do but change the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide for the foreſide; and the numbers ſet to the hours, ſtill keeping the center upwards, and the ſtile pointing downwards, this pattern will ſerve for the South-weſt face of a plane, whoſe declination is the ſame as before.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee by diligent obſervation, this pattern may be made to ſerve for four Dials, which being well underſtood, will be a great help to the Artiſt.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> How to draw a Diall upon an horizontall plane, otherwiſe then in the eighth Chapter was ſhewed.</head>
               <p>ALthough I have plainly and perfectly ſhewed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the horizontall, the direct South or North, as well erect as inclining; and the South or North erect declining Dials, in the four former Chapters: yet to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them that delight in variety, I have here declared another way, whereby you may make them moſt artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and geometrically; not being tied to the uſe of the Canons; (which indeed of all others is moſt exact, but not ſo eaſie to be underſtood) nor to any one Inſtrument (which may be abſent from me, when I ſhould need it) although in this Treatiſe I do perform the whole by a plain Quadrant.</p>
               <p>Therefore by the firſt Chapter, having found the plane to be horizontall; by the fourth Chapter draw the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian line A B, and croſſe it at right angles in the middle with the line D E, which is the line of Eaſt and Weſt, and ſerveth for the hour of ſix at morning, and ſix at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening.</p>

               <p>So likewiſe you may take one half the Chord H, and place it in the line of the ſtile from C to K, from which point K, take the ſhorteſt extent unto the meridian, with this diſtance ſet one foot in H, and with the other make on each ſide the meridian a mark in the ſame Chord line, through which you ſhall draw the hour-lines of 2 and 10.</p>
               <p>And thus you may proceed with the reſt of the lines, as the Figure will ſhew better then many words; for this is ſooner wrought then ſpoken.</p>
               <p>And if you would have the hours before and after ſix, you may extend them through the center, as was ſhewed in the 8 Chapter.</p>

               <p>THe work of this, is almoſt like unto the other before; the difference is onely in the elevation of the pole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the plane: for in the horizontall plane, the elevation is equall to the latitude of the place; and in all direct ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticals being erect, the elevation of the pole above the plane is equall to the complement of the latitude, but if they ſhall incline towards the horizon, then ſhall you finde the elevation of the pole above the plane by the 10 Chapter.</p>

               <p>The elevation of the pole above the plane being known, the making of theſe Dials are all alike; therefore by the ſecond Chapter draw the line EW parallel to the horizon, and from the middle thereof ſet fall the perpendicular ZN which ſhall be the meridian of the plane, and alſo the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of the place, ſerving for the line of 12, and alſo for the Subſtile, over which the ſtile muſt hang, both in erect and inclining planes being direct.</p>

               <p>This being done, divide each Quadrant of your Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle into ſix equall parts, ſo ſhall you have 5 points, by which you may draw 5 Chord lines, cutting the meridian at right angles in the points I K L M N.</p>
               <p>This being done, take the half of each Chord, and place it from the center Z along upon the line of the ſtile, as here you ſee; the half of the Chord N from Z to A, and one half the Chord M from Z to B, and half the Chord L from Z to C, and one half the Chord-lines I and K, ſet from Z unto D and G; now from each of theſe points, take the neereſt extent unto the meridian Z N, and place them upon their proper Chord lines from the meridian on both ſides thereof; ſo ſhall you have two points on each Chord, through which you ſhall draw the hour-lines from the center of your Diall, as the ſhorteſt extent from the point A unto the meridian, ſet in the Chord N from the meridian both wayes, ſhall give you the points for 1 and 11; ſo ſhall the ſhorteſt extent from the point B (being placed from the meridian both ways in the Chord M) give you the two points for 10 and 2, and ſo you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with the reſt; thus doing, you ſhall have in each Chord two points, on each ſide the meridian one; through which, and from the center <hi>Z,</hi> you may draw your houre-lines at pleaſure, without exceeding the limits of your plane.

               <p>IN all erect declining planes, when the declination is found, there is three things more to be conſidered before we can come to the drawing of the Diall.</p>

               <p>Theſe three may be both artificially, eaſily, and ſpeedily, performed after this manner following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, deſcribe a Quadrant, as A B C, then ſuppoſing your Latitude to be 52 deg. 30 min. take it from your Scale, and ſet it from B to E in the arch of the Quadrant, and draw the line E D parallel to A B, cutting the line A C in the point D, then take the diſtance D E, and ſetting one foot in the center A, with the other deſcribe the arch G H O R.</p>

Wherein the Meridian being placed according to his aſcenſion from the horizontall line, ſhall be in place of the ſubſtile, unto which if you draw a line ſquare, it ſhall ſerve for the Equator.

Therefore, firſt draw the Horizontall line A B, wherein make choice of a center as at C, whereon deſcribe an occult arch of a Circle as B E: then into this arch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Meridians aſcenſion 69 deg. 33 min. from B to E, and draw the line CE for the meridian of the plane, and for the ſubſtilar, and if you draw a line ſquare to this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilar, it ſhall be the Equator.</p>

               <p>Then let the Semidiameter A B be divided into 90 un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall parts, (called right Sines) either from the Table of naturall Sines by help of a decimall Scale, equall to the Semidiameter A B, or elſe by taking the neereſt extents from each degree of your Quadrant, unto the ſide A B, and placing them upon the ſide A B each after other, from the center A towards B, you ſhall exactly divide the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter A B into 90 unequall diviſions called right Sines.</p>

               <p>Then at the ſame inſtant, as neer as may be, take the Suns altitude, that ſo you may finde the Suns Azimuth from the Eaſt or Weſt points; by the 21 Chapter of the fourth Book.</p>
               <p>Having thus gotten the horizontall diſtance, with the Azimuth of the Sun for the ſame time, deſcribe a Circle as A B C D, repreſenting the horizontall circle, and draw the diameter A C, which ſhall repreſent the horizontall line F G of the laſt Chapter. Now ſuppoſing the horizontall diſtance to be 38 deg. 30 min. the angle O A B of the laſt Chapter, place it from C Southward to E (that is from the ſame end of the horizontall line with which the angle was made upon the plane) and draw the line E Z: Then

               <p>IN the drawing of all theſe kinde of Dials by help of this Quadrant, when the Latitude of the place, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the plane is known, two things more is to be conſidered: Firſt, the elevation of the Pole above the plane,: Secondly, the inclination of the Meridian of the plane, to the Meridian of the place; both which will ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be found when you are ready for them.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, draw the line D A F as before, from the middle whereof let fall the perpendicular A B for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilar, and at the diſtance of the tangent line D E, draw the line C B E parallel to the line D A F.</p>
               <p>Now to finde the elevation of the pole above the plane, lay the threed upon the co-ſine of the Latitude counted on the limb, and take it over at the neereſt extent from the co-ſine of the declination, which diſtance ſhall be the ſine of the elevation of the pole above the plane.</p>
               <p>So the declination of the plane being 32 deg. in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of 52 deg. 30 min. the elevation of the Pole above the plane will be 31 deg. 5 min. from the ſine of which take the neereſt extent unto the line of Latitudes, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſet from A to D and F both wayes, and from B to C and E, and draw the lines D C and E F, making the long ſquare C D F E, as in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>For the inclination of Meridians, take the ſine of the declination of the plane, and ſetting one foot in the co-ſine of the ſtiles elevation, with the other lay the threed to the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115735:80"/> neereſt diſtance, ſo ſhall it ſhew upon the limb the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Meridians to be 38 deg. 13 min.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>The threed lying ſtill in this poſition, obſerve which of the houres and where it cutteth; which will be the ſlope line <hi>n</hi> I in the point <hi>y;</hi> to this point <hi>y</hi> ſet the bead, which by this means is fitted to the deſcription of this Diall: the threed lying ſtill in the former poſition, you ſhall ſee it cut the tangent D E in the point S upon the Quadrant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take D S with your Compaſſes, and prick it down here from D to 6, with this ſame diſtance from the ſine of 90 deg. open the threed to the leaſt diſtance, and taking
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115735:80"/> it over from the ſine of the height of the ſtile; you ſhall have the diſtance from B to 12. And here note, that as in the 13 Chapter of the third Book, the ſubſtile is placed on that ſide the Meridian which is contrary to the planes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; ſo here the Meridian is placed on that ſide the ſubſtile whereon the declination of the plane is.</p>
               <p>The bead being thus fitted, apply it to every houre-line by removing the threed, as firſt, I remove it to the lines <hi>m h</hi> and B <hi>g,</hi> and it will cut the line D E upon the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant in <hi>r</hi> and <hi>q,</hi> therefore I take D <hi>r</hi> and D <hi>q,</hi> and prick them down from D to 5 and 4, with theſe ſame diſtances open the threed as before from the ſine of 90; and by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it over from the ſine of the height of the ſtile, you ſhall have the diſtances B 11 and B 10: again, the bead being applyed to the line <hi>k</hi> E; the threed will cut the co-tangent line in T, therefore take F T from your Quadrant, and prick it down here from F to 1, with this fame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, open the threed from the ſine of 90 deg. as before, and by taking it over from the ſine of the height of the pole above the plane, you ſhall have the diſtance B 7: then again, the bead being applyed to the lines <hi>l</hi> O and F P, the threed will cut the co-tangent line F E in V and W, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take F V and F W, and prick them down here from F to 2 and 3, with theſe diſtances open the threed from the ſine of 90 deg. and take them over from the ſine of the height of the ſtile, ſo ſhall you have the diſtances B 8 and B 9, thus have you the twelve houres pricked down, by which points and the centre A, you may draw the houre-lines, as here you ſee.</p>
               <p>In the like manner may the half hours be ſupplyed.</p>
               <p>The Diall being thus drawn on paper, you muſt place it ſo upon the plane, that the twelve a clock houre-line may
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115735:81"/> be perpendicular unto the Horizon, according to the 11 or 15 Chapters of the third Book.</p>
               <p>Note, that if the inclination of Meridians ſhall be more then 45 deg. ſo that the threed doth cut the co-tangent line F E, then you muſt take the diſtance from F to the threed, and prick it down either from D or from F upon the line D C or F E for the twelve a clock point, according as the plane ſhall decline either Eaſtward or Weſtward, and his parallel taken from the ſine of the height of the ſtile, ſhall give the diſtance from B to 6, and ſo of the reſt.</p>

               <p>IN theſe planes, as in the former, when we have the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the place and the inclination of the plane, we have two things more to conſider before we can draw the houre-lines upon the plane.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the elevation of the Pole above the plane: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the inclination of both Meridians.</p>
               <p>For the elevation of the Pole above the plane, lay the threed upon the Latitude counted in the limb, and take it over at the neereſt extent from the co-ſine of the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which diſtance ſhall be the ſine of the elevation of the Pole above the plane.</p>
               <p>So in the Latitude of 52 deg. 30 min. if a plane ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline 40 deg. to the Horizon, the height of the ſtile will be 37 deg. 26 min. with which you may proceed to make your parallelogram or long ſquare, as in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:115735:81"/>
               <p>Then for the inclination of Meridians, take the ſine of the inclination of the plane with your Compaſſes, and ſetting one foot in the co-ſine of the the Poles elevation above the plane, with the other lay the threed to the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt diſtance, and it will ſhew upon the limb the inclination required.</p>

               <p>And you may alſo ſee where the threed cutteth the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangent line E F, that ſo you may take the diſtance from the point F upon the Quadrant, unto the point of interſection of the threed with the co-tangent line; this diſtance you muſt ſet here from D to 12, and with the ſame, open the threed from the ſine of 90 deg. as before, and take it over from the ſine of the height of the ſtile, which ſhall be the diſtance from B to 6, and ſo you may proceed to prick down the reſt of the hours as in the laſt Chap was ſhewed.</p>
               <p>In all theſe planes you muſt place the line of twelve parallel to the Horizon, according to the 17 Chapter of the third Book, in which Chapter is fully ſhewed the true ſcituation of this Diall upon the plane.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL Circles of the Sphere whether great or ſmall, that may be projected upon any Diall-plane, become various according as the planes on which they are to be drawn are ſcituate; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, all great Circles, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſuch as divide the Sphere into two equal parts, as all <hi>Houres, Azimuths,</hi> and <hi>Horizons,</hi> are ſtreight lines, though variouſly projected, according as the planes on which they are drawn doe lie in reſpect of them. And
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115735:86"/> all ſmall Circles, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as divide the Sphere unequally, are <hi>Conick Sections,</hi> namely, either <hi>Elypſes, Hyperbola's,</hi> or <hi>Parabola's,</hi> except they be drawn upon ſuch planes as lie parallel to thoſe ſmaller Circles, and therefore the parallels of declination in the Equinoctial plane, and the Circles of Altitude in an Horizontall plane, are perfect Circles. For the Equinoctiall Diall lying in the very plain of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall Circle is parallel to all the parallels of declination; as the Horizontall Diall lying in the very plain of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, is parallel to all the Almicanters or Circles of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the Sun in his courſe moveth continually between the two Tropicks; and never exceedeth thoſe bounds; ſo likewiſe, all Aſtronomicall concluſions that are to be drawn upon any Diall plane, are limited either by the Equinoctiall, or by one or both of the Tropicks: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is requiſite; firſt, to ſhew you how to deſcribe the Equinoctiall and the Tropicks upon all kinde of planes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is them that limit and confine all other intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate parallels, whether they be of the Suns entrance into the Signes, or the Diurnall arches for the length of the day. And therefore I ſhall firſt ſhew you how to perform this work upon ſuch planes as lie parallel to the Axis of the World, as doe the Eaſt and Weſt Dials, and the Polar, whether direct or declining.</p>

                  <p>HOw to make an Eaſt or Weſt Diall you are taught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, therefore let the Square A B C D be a plane, on which there is an Eaſt Diall drawn, the height of the ſtile being equall to the diſtance between the houres of 9 and 6,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115735:86"/> noted there with the letters E G, and let it be required to draw upon the ſame plane the Equinoctiall and the two Tropicks. Now the Equinoctiall being a great circle of the Sphere, it is therefore a ſtreight line, and is repreſented in the Diall following by the line H F. The houre-lines and the Equinoctiall being thus drawn, we may proceed to the reſt of the work in this manner.</p>

                  <p>Having fitted your Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, you muſt have recourſ to your Diall, and from thence with your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes you muſt firſt take
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115735:87"/> out the diſtance E G (equall to the height of the ſtile of the ſame Diall) and prick it down in the Trigon from O to P, and draw the line P 6 perpendicular to O R.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, going to your plane again, take the diſtance from G the top of the ſtile, to 7 in the Equinoctiall of your plane; and place that diſtance in the Trigon from O to <hi>q,</hi> and draw the line <hi>q</hi> 7 perpendicular to O R. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, take out of your plane the diſtance G 8, and prick it down in your Trigon from O to <hi>r,</hi> and draw the line <hi>r</hi> 8 perpendicular to O R. Fourthly, take out of your plane the diſtance G 9, and prick it down in your Trigon from O to <hi>s;</hi> and draw <hi>s</hi> 9 perpendicular to O R. Fifthly, take out of your plane the diſtance G 10; and prick it down in your Trigon from O to <hi>t,</hi> and draw <hi>t</hi> 10 perpendicular to O R. Laſtly, take the diſtance G 11, and prick it down in your Trigon from O to <hi>v,</hi> and draw <hi>v</hi> 11 perpendicular to O R, as before.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diſtances being, all of them, taken out of your plane, and placed on your Trigon, it reſteth now to ſhew you how they muſt be again transferred from the Trigon to the plane.

                  <p>Theſe parallels being placed in your Trigon according to their true declination from the Equinoctiall, they are to be transferred into your plane in all reſpects as the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks were, by taking out of your Trigon the diſtances from the line O R, to the ſeverall points where the hours
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115735:89"/> croſſe the parallel, and place the ſame diſtances upon your plane from the Aequinoctiall upon the reſpective hour-lines, from which they were taken out of the Trigon, and through theſe points draw the lines in your plane, which ſhall be the true parallels of the Suns courſe at his entrance into all the 12 Signes of the Zodiaque, to which you may ſet the Characters of the Signes, as you ſee done in the figure.</p>
                  <p>¶And here note, that if you draw upon your plane the halves and quarters of houres, and put them into your Trigon, and transfer them to your plane again, you ſhall then have more points, through which your parallels muſt paſſe, which will much help you in the drawing thereof, (eſpecially in large planes) for there is no better way to draw theſe kinde of lines, but by finding a great number of points, and ſo draw them by hand.</p>
                  <p>¶Note alſo, that whatſoever is here ſpoken of the Eaſt and Weſt Dials, the ſame in all reſpects is to be obſerved in putting on the parallels of the Suns courſe in all planes that lie parallel to the Axis of the world as the Polar, whether direct or declining.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe kindes of planes, as the Eaſt, Weſt, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the ſtile were beſt to be made of a ſtreight piece of wyer, equall in length to the line E G, fixed in the point E, ſtanding perpendicular unto the plane, the end thereof at G being filed very fine and ſharpe, proportionable to the greatneſſe of the plane, for all theſe Aſtronomicall concluſions are ſhewed (not by the ſhadow of the whole
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115735:89"/> length of the ſtile, but) by the very Apex or top thereof, and therefore the more care ought to be had in the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and making of it.</p>
                  <p>¶The line MEN in the former Eaſt Diall is called the Horizontall line, becauſe it lyeth parallel to the Horizon, and by the meeting of the parallels of the Suns courſe with this line, the riſing of the Sun may be neerly eſtimated, for there you ſee that the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick of <hi>Cancer</hi> cutteth this line neer the point M, which is a little before the four a clock hour-line, which ſheweth, that when the Sun is in the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> he riſeth ſomewhat before four in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in like manner the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn</hi> cutteth the Horizontall line ſomething after 8, at which time the Sun riſeth being in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> but this by the way the farther uſe of this line ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.</p>
                  <p>I have been the larger in the work of this plane, becauſe I intend to be more brief in thoſe which follow, and this being well and truly underſtood, the others will need very few precepts or examples; yet I ſhall not omit any thing, but make it apparent to the meaneſt capacity.

One example therefore in one plane will be ſufficient for all the reſt. Therefore, in the latitude of 52 deg. 30 min. Let it be required to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Equinoctiall, and the two Tropicks in a full South erect plane.</p>
                  <p>Having drawn your Diall, with the houres, halves and quarters, as alſo the line C Q for the ſtile, you muſt make choice of ſome convenient point in the ſtile as at S for the Gnodus or knot which muſt give the ſhadow to the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks and other parallels of declination, for all theſe Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall concluſions are not ſhewed by the ſhadow of the whole length of the ſtile or Axis, as the houre is, but by ſome point therein which repreſenteth the center of the earth, which in the Diall following is the point S, and the triangular ſtile in that Diall is repreſented by the triangle C S L, whereof C L is called the ſubſtilar, C S the Axis of the ſtile, and S L the perpendicular ſtile, the top of which, <hi>viz.</hi> S, is the point we are in this place to reſpect.</p>
                  <p>The Diall being drawn, and the Triangle C S L made equall to the Cock of the Diall, you muſt upon a piece of paſtboard draw the Triangle O P R equall to the ſtile in your Diall C S L, making R O equall to C L the ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, P O equall to C S the axis of the ſtile, and P R equall to S L the length of the perpendicular ſtile.</p>
                  <p>Then from the point P, raiſe a perpendicular as P B, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Equinoctiall, and on P as a center, deſcribe

Thirdly, take out of your plane the diſtance C <hi>d,</hi> and place it in your Trigon from O unto <hi>d,</hi> and draw the line O <hi>d</hi> 3, for the houres of 9 and 3. Fourthly, from our plane take the diſtance C <hi>e,</hi> and ſet in your Trigon from O unto <hi>e,</hi> and draw the line O <hi>e</hi> 4 repreſenting the houres of 4 and 8.

This line ought firſt to be drawn, becauſe it is very improper to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Tropicks or other parallels of declination, above the Horizontall line, becauſe at what houre any parallel of declination cutteth this line, on either ſide of the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, at that time doth the Sun riſe or ſet, as was inſtanced in the laſt.</p>

                  <p>Now the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn</hi> muſt be put upon your plane in the ſame manner as that of <hi>Cancer,</hi> by taking out of your Trigon the diſtances from O, where the ſeverall houre-lines <hi>a b c d e</hi> doe cut the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn</hi> P C, and place them on your plane from the center C upon the reſpective houre-lines, and through thoſe points ſo found, draw the line ♑ ♑, repreſenting the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn.</hi>

                  <p>¶And in the ſame manner may the parallels of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Signes be drawn upon your plane, by placing them into your Trigon according to their declinations, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards transfer them into your plane, as you ſee in the former figure.</p>
                  <p>The rules that have been here given for the deſcribing of the parallels of the Signes in this erect direct plane, is univerſall in all planes, obſerving this one exception; that whereas in all erect direct planes the Equinoctiall is drawn perpendicular to the Meridian or line of 12, ſo in all other planes whatſoever, the Equinoctioll muſt be drawn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular to the ſubſtile, and then the work will be the ſame in all reſpects, as may appear more largely in the next Section.</p>

                  </table> that when the day is 12 houres long the Sun hath then no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, but is in the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall; but when the day is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 11 or 13 houres long, the declination is then 5 deg. 43 min. and when the day is either 9 or 15 houres long, the Sun hath 16 deg. 22 min. of decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo for the reſt, as in the Table.</p>
               <p>For the placing of theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels of the length of the day upon any of the forementioned planes; you muſt inſert theſe angles of declination into your Trigon between the Tropicks, and proceed in all reſpects as before. I will therefore give you but one example, which ſhall be in a full South plane, upon which and the Horizontall theſe arches doe appear moſt uniform.</p>
               <p>Now let it be required to draw the parallels of the Suns courſe, when the day is 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115735:95"/> houres long; upon a full South plane in the Latitude of 52 deg. 30 min.</p>
               <p>Having drawn your Diall with Houres halves and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and alſo made choiſe of ſome convenient point in the ſtile to give the ſhadow, and draw the horizontall line C D, then make the triangle S A R in this Trigon equall to the triangle S A R in the following South Diall; as S A e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the Axis of the ſtile, A R equall to the ſubſtilar, and R S equall to the perpendicular ſtile: then draw the perpendiculars S G for the Equinoctiall, and deſcribe the arch O G P, making G O and G P each of them 23 deg. 31 min. for the two Tropicks, which you muſt transfer into your plane as before.</p>
               <p>Now for the drawing of the parallels of the length of the day, you muſt have recourſe to the little Table before going, and therein ſee what declination the Sun hath at ſuch a day as you would put into your plane, as when the day is either 8 or 16 houres long, the declination is 20 deg. 59 min. therefore place in your Trigon 20 deg. 59 min. from G unto <hi>a</hi> both wayes, and draw the lines S <hi>a</hi> and S <hi>a,</hi> marking them at the ends with 8 and 16 the length of the day for which they ſerve. Likewiſe; when the day is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 9 or 15 houres long, then the Suns declination is 16 deg. 22 min. therefore ſet 16 deg. 22 min. from G unto <hi>b</hi> both wayes; and draw S <hi>b</hi> and S <hi>b.</hi> Alſo when the day is either 10 or 14 houres long, then the declination is 11 deg. 14 min. which ſet from G to <hi>c</hi> both wayes, and draw S <hi>c</hi> and S <hi>c.</hi> Laſtly, when the day is 11 or 13 houres long the declination is 5 deg. 43 min. which ſet from G unto <hi>d</hi> both wayes, and draw S <hi>d</hi> and S <hi>d,</hi> noting them with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers anſwering to the length of the day, as you ſee in the Trigon, when the day is juſt 12 houres long it is Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall

               <p>For the manner how to transfer theſe parallels of the length of the day into the plane, it is to be performed in all reſpects as in the former Chapter for the inſerting of the Signes, not at all differing therefrom, and therefore I ſhall
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115735:96"/> forbeare to give you any farther inſtructions for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof but give you the figure of a South plane with theſe parallels drawn thereon, which will inſtruct more then a whole Chapter of information.</p>

               <p>And thus much for the drawing of the parallels of the Signes and Diurnall arches in all kinde of planes. I will now proceed to ſhew you how ſome other Aſtronomicall concluſions (which are very pleaſing and delightfull) may be inſcribed upon all ſorts of Dials.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Shewing how the Italian and Babyloniſh houres may be drawn upon all kinde of planes.</head>
               <p>THe Italians account their houres from the Suns ſetting, and the Babylonians from his riſing, ſo that theſe kinde of houre-lines being drawn upon any plane, you may know (by inſpection only) how many houres are paſt ſince the laſt ſetting or riſing of the Sun. The inſcription of theſe houre-lines into any of the former planes is very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, the work of the laſt Chapter being well underſtood.</p>
               <p>Becauſe that upon a full South or an Horizontall plane, theſe houre-lines ſhew themſelves moſt uniform, I have therefore for example ſake, made choice of a full South Diall, upon which it ſhall be ſhewn how to draw both the Italian and Babyloniſh houres.</p>
               <p>Your Diall being drawn, and the two Tropicks and the Equinoctial thereon inſcribed, and alſo the Horizontall line, you muſt draw in your Diall two obſcure parallels of the length of the day, one when the day is 8 houres, and the other when the day is 16 houres long, expreſſed in the following Dial by the two pricked arches neer the two Tropicks, the uppermoſt of which is the parallel of the Suns courſe when the day is 8 houres long, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is the parallel of his courſe when the day is 16 houres
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115735:97"/> long, &amp; the Aequinoctiall is the parallel of the Suns courſe when the day is 12 houres long.</p>
               <p>Your Diall being thus prepared, and theſe parallels thus inſerted, the inſcription of theſe houre-lines is very eaſie and plain to be underſtood. To begin then with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Babyloniſh houres (which are the houres from the Suns riſing.) Firſt, It is apparent that when the day is 8 houres long, that the Sun riſeth at 8 in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that at that time, the firſt houre after the ſuns riſing is 9 in the morning. Secondly, when the day is 12 hours long, the Sun riſeth at 6 in the morning, ſo that at that time the firſt houre after the ſuns riſing is 7 in the morning. Thirdly, when the day is 16 houres long, the Sun riſeth at 4 in the morning, ſo that the firſt houre after his riſing is 5 in the morning, as plainly appeareth by this Table:

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115735:98"/> the day, the ſeventh houre from the ſuns riſing is 3 in the afternoon, therefore obſerve where the houre-line of three croſſeth the parallel of 8 houres, which is at <hi>a.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the Table you ſee that in the parallel of 12 hours for the length of the day, the ſeventh houre from ſun ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is then 1 in the afternoon, wherefore obſerve where the houre-line of 1 croſſeth the Equinoctiall, which is at <hi>b.</hi> Thirdly, by the Table you ſee that in the parallel of 16 houres for the length of the day, the ſeveth houre from the ſuns riſing is 11 before noon, therefore obſerve where the houre-line of 11 croſſeth the parallel of 16 hours, which is at <hi>c:</hi> then draw the ſtreight line <hi>a b c,</hi> which ſhall be the ſeventh Babyloniſh houre, or the ſeventh hour from the ſuns riſing all the year long.</p>
               <p>And by this rule, and the help of the Table, you may draw all the other houres from ſun riſing, as you ſee them drawn in the figure, and put numbers to them as you ſee there done.</p>
               <p n="1">¶1 Note, That if any of the points you are to make uſe of for the drawing of any of theſe houres fall without your plane, you muſt in this caſe extend your houre-line; parallel and Equinoctiall, beyond the limits of your Diall-plane, and there make uſe of the points, but you need extend the line you draw no farther then the bounds of the plane, as here in the figure you ſee the firſt houre from Sun riſing croſſeth not the Equinoctiall and the houre-line of 7 within the plane, but if the Equinoctiall and the houre-line of 7 were extended, it would croſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:115735:98"/>¶2 Note, That if any of the three points you are to make uſe of doe ſo far exceed the limits of your plane, that it will be either impoſſible (or at leaſt very troubleſome) to extend the houre-lines ſo far that then in that caſe any two of the three points will ſufficiently ſerve the turn.</p>
               <p n="3">¶3 Note, That as the houres from ſun riſing were put into the plane, by the ſame rule may the hours from ſun ſetting (or Italian houres) be inſerted, the difference being only in the numbring of them; the houres from the ſun riſing being numbered from the Weſt ſide of the Horizontall line by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11; and the houres from the ſuns ſetting are denominated from the Eaſt ſide of the Horizon, and numbered backwards by 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, and 13, as in the figure doth evidently appear.</p>
               <p n="4">¶4 Note, That theſe Italian and Babyloniſh hours are inſcribed on all planes by help of this little Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the rules and cautions delivered in this Chapter, and therefore more examples were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Shewing how the Jewiſh hours may be drawn upon any plane.</head>
               <p>IT was the cuſtome of the Ancients to divide their day and alſo their night (whether long or ſhort) into 12 equal parts, beginning their day at the ſuns riſing, and their
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115735:99"/> night at the ſuns ſetting; ſo that 12 of the clock at noon was alwayes the ſixth houre of their day, and 12 at night was alwayes the ſixth hour of their night, and according to this diviſion were their Dials drawn; ſo that all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the houres of their day were longer then the houres of their night; and all the Winter, the houres of their night were longer then thoſe of their day; and when the Sun is in the Equinoctiall, then the houres of their day and night were equall, and the ſame with thoſe of our account, but at all other times of the year different.</p>
               <p>The inſcribing of theſe hours into all kinde of planes is very eaſie, being much like the drawing of the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and Italian houres before taught.</p>
               <p>Having therefore drawn your Diall (which in this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (for the avoyding of many figures) we will have to be the full South plane uſed before in Chap. 2. of this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix) with the houres, halves, and quarters, and alſo drawn the two Tropicks and the parallels of the length of the day thereupon, as you ſee here done in this figure. Then make choice of two parallels of the length of the day, which muſt be both of them equidiſtant from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall, which let be the parallels of 9 houres and 15 houres, both which are three houres different from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall on either ſide thereof, and theſe two parallels are the moſt convenient for this our purpoſe, becauſe the Jewiſh hours will fall (in theſe two parallels) juſtly upon the houres, halves and quarters of the common houre-lines, and ſo be the eaſier drawn. Now the points through which every one of the Jewiſh hours muſt paſſe is exactly ſhewed by this little Table, wherein you may ſee that the firſt Jewiſh houre muſt be drawn through 5 houres 45 min. (or 5 houres three quarters) in the parallel of 15: through 7
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115735:99"/> hours in the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial:

               <p>The inſcription of theſe into all kinde of planes is (in a manner) the ſame with the parallels of declination, but whereas in the drawing the parallels of declination, you take the houre-lines out of your plane and put them in a Trigon; ſo in this you muſt take the Azimuths out of your plane, and put them into a Trigon for that purpoſe, and ſo transfer them to the plane again as you did the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and becauſe theſe are ſmall circles, therefore they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Conick ſections, except on ſuch planes as lie parallel to the Zenith, which is only the Horizontall.</p>
